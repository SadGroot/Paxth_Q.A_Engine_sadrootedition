# Elec-ITACC-Printers, Scanners & Accessories: sample-format mapping rules

Source: `OneDrive_2_10-15-2026/Elec-ITACC-Printers, Scanners & Accessories.xls`, sheet `Template`. Catalog headers: row 2, left to right. Sample product row 3. Row 1 contains merged group labels; other populated rows are annotations, as explained below.

Learn formatting only. Obtain actual facts from SAP first, then other verified evidence where the existing workflow permits. Existing supplied values and missing-value handling remain governed by the application. Sample identities, claims, quantities, and classifications are never defaults or allowed-value lists. Placeholder examples show shape only and must never be emitted literally.

Keep the exact headers and their order. The six application pass-through fields are sku, base_code, attributes__lulu_ean, attributes__shipping_weight, attributes__brand, and attributes__lulu_product_type. Name may be generated only when missing. No required/optional classifications or IDQ flags are inferred. Blank samples establish neither optionality nor absence; fallback advice is explicitly labeled. Units/spacing are specific to this template; a single sample does not establish fixed precision. Qualifiers such as Up to and Approx. apply only when current source facts support them.

### Source annotations and unresolved metadata

Lower-row metadata is retained as source guidance only: row 6: `mandatory attributes`; row 7: `attributes__print_technology`, `New Header Added`; row 8: `attributes__print_technology`.

Mandatory labels, slash alternatives, new-header labels, and misspelled references do not add output columns, IDQ flags, or required/optional classifications. Actual row-2 keys govern output.

Explicit bullet priorities are applied by their literal column alignment: `attributes__bullet_point_1` → Print technology; `attributes__bullet_point_2` → Features; `attributes__bullet_point_3` → Features; `attributes__bullet_point_4` → Features; `attributes__bullet_point_5` → Features; `attributes__bullet_point_6` → Features.

## sku

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP sku as exact identifier text, including meaningful punctuation and leading zeroes. Do not generate or copy sample identifiers.

## base_code

## attributes__bullet_point_3

Explicit template priority: Features. Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_4

Explicit template priority: Features. Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_5

Explicit template priority: Features. Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_6
