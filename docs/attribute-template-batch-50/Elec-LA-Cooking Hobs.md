# Elec-LA-Cooking Hobs: sample-format mapping rules

Source: `OneDrive_2_10-15-2026/Elec-LA-Cooking Hobs.xls`, sheet `Cooking Hobs`. Catalog headers: row 2, left to right. Sample product row 3. Row 1 contains merged group labels; other populated rows are annotations, as explained below.

Learn formatting only. Obtain actual facts from SAP first, then other verified evidence where the existing workflow permits. Existing supplied values and missing-value handling remain governed by the application. Sample identities, claims, quantities, and classifications are never defaults or allowed-value lists. Placeholder examples show shape only and must never be emitted literally.

Keep the exact headers and their order. The six application pass-through fields are sku, base_code, attributes__lulu_ean, attributes__shipping_weight, attributes__brand, and attributes__lulu_product_type. Name may be generated only when missing. No required/optional classifications or IDQ flags are inferred. Blank samples establish neither optionality nor absence; fallback advice is explicitly labeled. Units/spacing are specific to this template; a single sample does not establish fixed precision. Qualifiers such as Up to and Approx. apply only when current source facts support them.

### Source annotations and unresolved metadata

Lower-row metadata is retained as source guidance only: row 6: `Mandatory attributes`; row 7: `attributes__burners_zones`; row 8: `attributes__size`; row 9: `attributes__wattage`; row 10: `attributes__material`.

Mandatory labels, slash alternatives, new-header labels, and misspelled references do not add output columns, IDQ flags, or required/optional classifications. Actual row-2 keys govern output.

Explicit bullet priorities are applied by their literal column alignment: `attributes__bullet_point_1` → No of Burners; `attributes__bullet_point_2` → Size; `attributes__bullet_point_3` → Material/Features; `attributes__bullet_point_4` → Wattage/Features; `attributes__bullet_point_5` → Features; `attributes__bullet_point_6` → Features.

The explicit title note below 75 characters is applied to product_title only.

## sku

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP sku as exact identifier text, including meaningful punctuation and leading zeroes. Do not generate or copy sample identifiers.

## base_code

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP base code as exact identifier text, including meaningful punctuation and leading zeroes. Do not generate or copy sample identifiers.

## attributes__lulu_ean

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP lulu ean as exact identifier text, including meaningful punctuation and leading zeroes. Do not generate or copy sample identifiers.

## attributes__shipping_weight

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP shipping-weight value. The bare sample number does not establish a unit; do not derive or convert it from product weight.

## name

Preserve an existing supplied product name. When missing and generation is requested, use the verified title-style product name below, with available distinguishing details and no empty separators.

## attributes__product_title

Write a concise plain-text title in the observed general shape `{Brand} {series/product/type} {verified key specification}, {verified distinguishing details}, {model}`. Include only available useful parts; secondary details use comma-and-space separation and the model appears last when supplied. The explicit annotation says below 75 characters: keep the title under 75 characters (at most 74).

## attributes__bullet_point_1

Explicit template priority: Size. Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_3

Explicit template priority: Material/Features. Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_4

Explicit template priority: Wattage/Features. Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_5

Explicit template priority: Features. Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_6

Explicit template priority: Features. Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__product_description

Write a factual plain-text paragraph, following the single-paragraph sample layout; the short example does not establish a fixed length. No sample contains HTML; this template establishes no HTML requirement.

## attributes__keywords

Use relevant lower-case search phrases separated by a comma and one space: `{product phrase}, {feature phrase}`. Select phrases from the current product facts.

## attributes__brand

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP brand exactly; sample brand names are never defaults.

## attributes__lulu_product_type
