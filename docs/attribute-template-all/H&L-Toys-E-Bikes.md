# H&L-Toys-E-Bikes: sample-format mapping rules

Source: `OneDrive_2_10-15-2026/H&L-Toys-E-Bikes.xls`, sheet `Toys E-Bikes`. Catalog headers: row 2, in the reviewed manifest order. Sample product rows: 3, 4. Grouping labels and lower-row metadata are excluded from the output headers; reviewed corrections are listed below.

Learn formatting only. Obtain actual facts from SAP first, then other verified evidence where the existing workflow permits. Existing supplied values and missing-value handling remain governed by the application. Sample identities, claims, quantities, and classifications are never defaults or allowed-value lists. Placeholder examples show shape only and must never be emitted literally.

Keep the exact headers and their order. The six application pass-through fields are sku, base_code, attributes__lulu_ean, attributes__shipping_weight, attributes__brand, and attributes__lulu_product_type. Name may be generated only when missing. No required/optional classifications or IDQ flags are inferred. Blank samples establish neither optionality nor absence; fallback advice is explicitly labeled. Units/spacing are specific to this template; a single sample does not establish fixed precision. Qualifiers such as Up to and Approx. apply only when current source facts support them.

### Source annotations and unresolved metadata

Lower-row metadata is retained as source guidance only: row 6: `Mandatory attributes`; row 7: `attributes__material`; row 8: `attributes__size`.

Mandatory labels, slash alternatives, new-header labels, and misspelled references do not add output columns, IDQ flags, or required/optional classifications. Actual row-2 keys govern output.

Explicit bullet priorities are applied by their literal column alignment: `attributes__bullet_point_1` → Material; `attributes__bullet_point_2` → Size/Dimensions; `attributes__bullet_point_3` → Features; `attributes__bullet_point_4` → Features; `attributes__bullet_point_5` → Features; `attributes__bullet_point_6` → Features.

Rows 3, 4 are distinct product examples, not instructions. Use all only for format evidence; observed unit/style alternatives remain source-dependent and do not establish default values.

## sku

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP sku as exact identifier text, including meaningful punctuation and leading zeroes. Do not generate or copy sample identifiers.

## base_code

## attributes__product_description

Write readable factual plain-text paragraphs separated by a blank line, following the sample layout; its paragraph count is not a requirement. No sample contains HTML; this template establishes no HTML requirement.

## attributes__keywords

Use relevant lower-case search phrases separated by a comma and one space: `{product phrase}, {feature phrase}`. Select phrases from the current product facts.

## attributes__brand

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP brand exactly; sample brand names are never defaults.

## attributes__lulu_product_type

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP product type under this exact canonical key. Do not add a legacy attributes__product_type alias.

## attributes__model

Use the verified model identifier as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation.

Use the verified marketed color as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation.

## attributes__material

Use the verified material or composition as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation.

## attributes__age_group

Use the verified minimum-age designation in the observed shape `{minimum age}+ years`, with no space before + and one before years. Do not infer suitability from size alone.

## attributes__ideal_for

Use the verified intended audience/use environments as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation.

## attributes__no_of_pieces

Use the verified piece count as number-only text, shape `{n}`, with no added unit or label. Preserve identifiers/notation rather than performing arithmetic on the sample.

## attributes__pack

Use the verified pack composition/count as number-only text, shape `{n}`, with no added unit or label. Preserve identifiers/notation rather than performing arithmetic on the sample.

## attributes__package_contents

Use a verified count plus item name in the observed shape `{count} {item}`, with one space. Do not infer quantities or included items.

## attributes__in_the_box

Use a verified count plus item name in the observed shape `{count} {item}`, with one space. Do not infer quantities or included items.

## attributes__product_dimensions

Use verified product dimensions in the observed shape `W{width} x D{depth} x H{height} cm`. Preserve axis labels/order, exact x versus × separator, spacing, and unit. Keep product and package measurements separate and convert only from known measurements.

## attributes__package_dimensions

Use verified package dimensions in the observed shape `W{width} x D{depth} x H{height} cm`. Preserve axis labels/order, exact x versus × separator, spacing, and unit. Keep product and package measurements separate and convert only from known measurements.

## attributes__weight

Keep meaningful source precision without imposing the sample decimal count. Keep product weight separate from pass-through shipping weight.

## attributes__size

Sample cell is blank in every sample product: no sample format evidence. Semantic fallback only: Use verified stated product size as concise plain text; preserve its source representation because no template-specific style is established.

## attributes__battery_capacity

Use the verified compound battery specification in the observed shape `{voltage}V {min}–{max} Ah`. Preserve no space before V, a space between voltage and capacity, and the space before Ah; retain a range only when supported.

## attributes__charging_time

Use the verified charging duration in the observed shape `{n} hours`. Use verified current-product measurements; preserve the observed unit case, spacing, and separator. Keep meaningful source precision without imposing the sample decimal count. Express time to charge, not operating or standby duration.

## attributes__no_of_wheels

Use the verified wheel count as number-only text, shape `{n}`, with no added unit or label. Preserve identifiers/notation rather than performing arithmetic on the sample.

## attributes__country_of_origin

Use the verified manufacturing country name as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation. Use the manufacturing country from evidence rather than brand origin or seller location.
