# H&L-S&F-O&G-Team Sports: sample-format mapping rules

Source: `OneDrive_2_10-15-2026/H&L-S&F-O&G-Team Sports.xls`, sheet `Team Sports`. Catalog headers: row 2, in the reviewed manifest order. Sample product rows: 3. Grouping labels and lower-row metadata are excluded from the output headers; reviewed corrections are listed below.

Learn formatting only. Obtain actual facts from SAP first, then other verified evidence where the existing workflow permits. Existing supplied values and missing-value handling remain governed by the application. Sample identities, claims, quantities, and classifications are never defaults or allowed-value lists. Placeholder examples show shape only and must never be emitted literally.

Keep the exact headers and their order. The six application pass-through fields are sku, base_code, attributes__lulu_ean, attributes__shipping_weight, attributes__brand, and attributes__lulu_product_type. Name may be generated only when missing. No required/optional classifications or IDQ flags are inferred. Blank samples establish neither optionality nor absence; fallback advice is explicitly labeled. Units/spacing are specific to this template; a single sample does not establish fixed precision. Qualifiers such as Up to and Approx. apply only when current source facts support them.

### Source annotations and unresolved metadata

No populated lower-row annotations are supplied. Sample content does not establish mandatory fields.

## sku

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP sku as exact identifier text, including meaningful punctuation and leading zeroes. Do not generate or copy sample identifiers.

## base_code

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP base code as exact identifier text, including meaningful punctuation and leading zeroes. Do not generate or copy sample identifiers.

## attributes__lulu_ean

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP lulu ean as exact identifier text, including meaningful punctuation and leading zeroes. Do not generate or copy sample identifiers.

## attributes__shipping_weight

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP shipping-weight value and its established application unit. Do not derive it from product weight or copy a sample weight.

## name

Preserve an existing supplied product name. When missing and generation is requested, use the verified title-style product name below, with available distinguishing details and no empty separators.

## attributes__product_title

Write a concise plain-text title in the observed general shape `{Brand} {series/product/type} {verified key specification}, {verified distinguishing details}, {model}`. Include only available useful parts; secondary details use comma-and-space separation and the model appears last when supplied.

## attributes__bullet_point_1

Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_2

Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_3

Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_4

Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_5

Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__bullet_point_6

Write one concise factual benefit phrase as plain text, without HTML or a list marker. Keep separate bullets distinct and use current verified facts only. The sample has no terminal full stop.

## attributes__product_description

Write readable factual plain-text paragraphs separated by a blank line, following the sample layout; its paragraph count is not a requirement. No sample contains HTML; this template establishes no HTML requirement.

## attributes__keywords

Use relevant lower-case search phrases separated by a comma and one space: `{product phrase}, {feature phrase}`. Select phrases from the current product facts.

## attributes__brand

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP brand exactly; sample brand names are never defaults.

## attributes__lulu_product_type

Application pass-through: preserve the supplied SAP product type under this exact canonical key. Do not add a legacy attributes__product_type alias.

## attributes__model

Use the verified model identifier as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation.

## attributes__color

Use the verified marketed color as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation.

## attributes__material

Use the verified material or composition as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation.

## attributes__gender

Use the verified intended audience designation as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation.

## attributes__ideal_for

Use the verified intended audience/use environments as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation.

## attributes__no_of_pieces

Use the verified piece count as number-only text, shape `{n}`, with no added unit or label. Preserve identifiers/notation rather than performing arithmetic on the sample.

## attributes__pack

Use the verified pack composition/count as number-only text, shape `{n}`, with no added unit or label. Preserve identifiers/notation rather than performing arithmetic on the sample.

## attributes__package_contents

Use a verified count plus item name in the observed shape `{count} {item}`, with one space. Do not infer quantities or included items.

## attributes__in_the_box

Use a verified count plus item name in the observed shape `{count} {item}`, with one space. Do not infer quantities or included items.

## attributes__product_dimensions

Sample cell is blank: no sample format evidence. Semantic fallback only: Use verified axis labels/order and original measurement units; no axis order or delimiter is established by this sample.

## attributes__package_dimensions

Sample cell is blank: no sample format evidence. Semantic fallback only: Use verified package dimensions with their actual axis meanings and units; do not reuse product measurements.

## attributes__weight

Use the verified product weight in the observed shape `{n} kg`. Use verified current-product measurements; preserve the observed unit case, spacing, and separator. Keep meaningful source precision without imposing the sample decimal count. Keep product weight separate from pass-through shipping weight.

## attributes__design

Sample cell is blank: no sample format evidence. Semantic fallback only: Use verified design/style as concise plain text; preserve its source representation because no template-specific style is established.

## attributes__pattern

Sample cell is blank: no sample format evidence. Semantic fallback only: Use verified surface pattern as concise plain text; preserve its source representation because no template-specific style is established.

## attributes__size

Sample cell is blank: no sample format evidence. Semantic fallback only: Use verified stated product size as concise plain text; preserve its source representation because no template-specific style is established.

## attributes__ball_size

Use the verified nominal ball-size designation in the observed shape `Size {code}`. Keep the size code distinct from a measured diameter.

## attributes__capacity

Sample cell is blank: no sample format evidence. Semantic fallback only: Use verified function-specific capacity as concise plain text; preserve its source representation because no template-specific style is established.

## attributes__features

Use the verified product features as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation.

## attributes__special_features

Sample cell is blank: no sample format evidence. Semantic fallback only: Use verified distinctive features as concise plain text; preserve its source representation because no template-specific style is established.

Sample cell is blank: no sample format evidence. Semantic fallback only: Use verified additional relevant product information as concise plain text; preserve its source representation because no template-specific style is established.

## attributes__note

Sample cell is blank: no sample format evidence. Semantic fallback only: Use verified product-specific caveats as concise plain text; preserve its source representation because no template-specific style is established.

## attributes__country_of_origin

Use the verified manufacturing country name as concise plain text, preserving official names, meaningful case, and punctuation. Use the manufacturing country from evidence rather than brand origin or seller location.
